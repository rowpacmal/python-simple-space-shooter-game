# ðŸš€ Simple Space Shooter Game in Python

ðŸŸ¡ **Status:** _Work in Progress_

This project is a beginner-friendly space shooter game built with Python. It's part of a personal challenge to learn Python from scratch, with no prior hands-on experience. The main goal is to develop a fully playable and replayable game loop while gaining practical programming skills along the way.
